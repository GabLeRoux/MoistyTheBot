#### HELP

### PRE-INSTALL
1- create yourself a bot at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me

2- manage you bot permission with bot ID at https://discordapi.com/permissions.html

3- invite the bot in a server that you are manager

### INSTALL (LOCALHOST)
~~~
# get in the project directory and open your terminal
$ npm install
$ mysql -u root -p 
$ source database.sql
$ exit
$ node server.js
~~~
then the bot should be online as long as the nodejs server is running, (note) it's really important to hide you bot token or someone could mess with you discord server by using the bot on his own nodejs server




### INVITE MY BOT (NO INSTALLATION)
Client ID: 321041087689129994

manage bot permission then invite the bot in your server at https://discordapi.com/permissions.html

(note) you must be server manager to be able to invite bot

(important) my bot is not always online since it's currently in developpement
